# Market_Finance
I am storing all of my projects in Python related to market finance here. 

This project contains the following directories:

- Brownian_Motion
This directory contains code related to simulating Brownian motion. It is used to model the behavior of a financial asset.

- Financial_Times-Fast_Reading
This directory contains documents and resources related to fast reading of financial press. These resources can help quickly understand the latest market news.

- Local_volatility
This directory contains code related to modeling the local volatility of a financial asset. Local volatility is a measure of volatility that varies with price and time.

- Option_Pricing
This directory contains code related to pricing financial options. Financial options are contracts that give their buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a financial asset at a predetermined price.

- Volatility_surface
This directory contains code related to modeling the volatility surface of a financial asset. The volatility surface is a graphical representation of the implied volatility of a financial asset as a function of its price and time to maturity.

Note: This project is for educational purposes only and should not be used for commercial purposes. The provided code is not exhaustive and may require modifications to meet specific needs.
