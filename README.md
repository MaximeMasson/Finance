# My Python projects for Market Finance
Welcome to my Github where I am storing all my projects in Python related to market finance. 

This project contains the following directories:

- Financial_Times-Fast_Reading : 
This directory contains an application that can summarize the daily market news of the Financial Times using the Chat GPT API. These resources can help quickly understand the latest news. I didn't optimised it yet, but updates will be made soon.

- Option_Pricing : 
This directory contains my code for pricing financial options using Monte Carlo and Black-Scholes methods. I also simulate the Greeks (sensitivity measures) of the options. I am currently working on making further modifications to the code.

- Volatility_surface : 
This directory contains code related to modeling the volatility surface of a financial asset. The volatility surface is a graphical representation of the implied volatility of a financial asset as a function of its price and time to maturity.

- Local_volatility : 
This directory contains code related to modeling the local volatility of a financial asset. Local volatility is a measure of volatility that varies with price and time.

Here is an example for AAPL at the beginning of 2023:

- Brownian_Motion : 
This directory contains code related to simulating Brownian motion. It is used to model the behavior of a financial asset.
